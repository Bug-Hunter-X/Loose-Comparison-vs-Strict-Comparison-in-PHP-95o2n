This repository contains an example of a common PHP bug involving loose comparison and its solution using strict comparison.  The `bug.php` file demonstrates the error and `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected code. Loose comparisons can lead to unexpected behavior and logical errors in your applications.  It is best practice to always use strict comparison (===) unless there is a specific need for loose comparison.
